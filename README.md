# About Me 
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Augsburg in the group of [Prof. Francesco Piazza](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/en/fakultaet/mntf/physik/groups/theo3/team/francesco-piazza/). Prior to that I was a post-doc at MPIPKS, Dresden. I received my Ph.D. ([thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s8qKV03teZyWtI6WsVnuPqxpTmsf3go1/view)) in Physics from Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai under the guidance of [Prof. Rajdeep Sensarma](https://sites.google.com/view/rsensarma/home).
