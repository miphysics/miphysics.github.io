## Dynamics of bosons from non-thermal initial states 
Describing the dynamics of quantum many-body systems starting from non-thermal initial states is a daunting task. We developed a field-theoretic method to describe dynamics of scalar fields (which is used to describe bosonic excitations e.g. phonons, magnons, photons etc.) from non-thermal Fock states.\
We used this method to study open-system dynamics of phonons coupled to thermal baths. We found that low-momenta photons coupled to a bath of fermions in 1D fail to thermalize. At low temperatures, strict phase-space constrains prevent the phonons to see the bath. On the other hand at high temperatures, formation of an undamped mode due to the diverging densityof states in the bath prevents thermalization.\ 
Further, we looked into the dynamics of a closed interacting system of bosons with dipole-moment conservation in addition to charge [$U(1)$] conservation. At thermal equilibrium, we found two
kind of phases: a condensed phase where both charge and dipole-moment are not consereved and a localized normal phase where both the charge and dipole-moment are conserved. We show that via non-equilibrium dynamics (e.g. quench, ramp) we can access an additional phase where charge is conserved but dipole-moment is not.
